      <p class="about-text">
        Zertte is a FIRST Tech Challenge team based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, made up of students from multiple schools, including the 
        <span class="highlight">
          “Academician Sh. Smagulov Specialized Boarding School for Gifted Children.”
        </span>
        We are united by curiosity, creativity, and a shared passion for engineering, robotics, and innovation.
        <br><br>
        Since our formation, we’ve grown not only as a team, but as a movement — building 
        <span class="highlight">
          bold ideas, designing powerful systems, and forming real connections
        </span>
        with experts, other teams, and our community.
        <br><br>
        We’ve qualified for international competitions and proudly represented Kazakhstan on the global stage. Our mission goes beyond winning: we aim to make robotics exciting, accessible, and meaningful for the next generation.
        <br><br>
        Every robot we build and every meeting we attend is powered by one thing: our passion for FTC.
